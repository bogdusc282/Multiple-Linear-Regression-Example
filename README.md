#Multiple Linear Regression Example

In this Multiple Linear Regression Example,
 we consider whether it is possible to predict the car engine size
 (in [cc]), from its Length, Seating Capacity and Fuel Tank Capacity.

The answer is YES! :) The current example clearly shows this by
 using the Multiple Linear Regression Machine Learning model.

To do this exercise, I have used a vehicle dataset from Kaggle. (Here is the address of this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho)

These datasets have different categories. In this exercise, I have chosen to explore whether it is possible to find the vehicleâ€™s engine size, by using only some of its technical parameters.

The Machine Learning model is implemented in Python.

The following figure shows the Multiple Linear Regression prediction
in this case.
